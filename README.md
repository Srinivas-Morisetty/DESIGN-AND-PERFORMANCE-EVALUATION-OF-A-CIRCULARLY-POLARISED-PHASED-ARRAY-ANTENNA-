## 📖 Overview

This project presents the **design, simulation, and performance analysis of a Circularly Polarized (CP) Microstrip Patch Array Antenna** for modern wireless and satellite communication systems.

Circular polarization improves communication reliability by reducing:

* Polarization mismatch losses
* Multipath fading
* Orientation sensitivity of devices

The antenna is designed using EM simulation tools and evaluated using parameters such as **Return Loss, VSWR, Gain, Axial Ratio, and Radiation Pattern**.
